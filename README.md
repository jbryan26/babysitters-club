# babysitters-club

This application contains logic to calculate the babysitter's wages for the night.

Some assumptions: 

The bedtime is dynamic, but restricted to before midnight.

The babysitter's shift must start before midnight.

The start and end time zone are assumed to be identical.

The logic can be found in the [BabysitterSalaryEngine](https://github.com/jbryan26/babysitters-club/blob/main/BabysitterzClub/app/src/main/java/com/ujimatech/babysitterzclub/BabysitterSalaryEngine.kt), the tests can be found in the [BabysitterTest](https://github.com/jbryan26/babysitters-club/blob/main/BabysitterzClub/app/src/test/java/com/ujimatech/babysitterzclub/BabysitterTest.kt) class.
